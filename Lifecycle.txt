There are three states in the react life cycle method 
1.Mounting 
2.Updating
3.Unmounting

Mounting->ComponentDidMount ->Here the component is loaded

Updating->ComponentDidUpdate ->Here the component is updated
UnMounting->ComponentWillUnmount  ->Here the component is removed

These life cycle methods are generally implemented for class components and for functional components we generally use react hooks


constructor is the first method which is called during the mounting stage 

Constructor:First write the template for the class component
import React from "react"

class App extends React.Component{
    constructor(){
        super();
        console.warn("constructor is called");
    }
    render(){
        console.warn("render is called")
        return(
            <>
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
            </>
        )
    }
}

So from this template it is clear that the constructor is called first followed by the render method.
